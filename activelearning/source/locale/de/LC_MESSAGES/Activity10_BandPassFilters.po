"In this tutorials we use the terminology taken from the user manual when "
"referring to the connections to the Red Pitaya STEMlab board hardware_. "
"Bode_ analyzer application is used to measure frequency response of Low "
"Pass and High Pass Filters. The Bode analyzer is an ideal application for"
" measuring frequency responses of the passive/active filters, complex "
"impedances and any other electronic circuit. The Gain/Phase frequency "
"response can be used to characterize any device under test completely, "
"you can perform linear and logarithmic sweeps. Gain and Phase can be "
"measured from 1Hz to 60MHz. The basic user interface enables quick "
"interaction and parameter settings. The Bode analyzer can be used for the"
" measurement of Stability of control circuits such as the DC/DC "
"converters in power supplies, Influence of termination on amplifiers or "
"filters, Ultrasonic and piezo electric systems and similar."

"A Band Pass Filter allows a specific range of frequencies to pass, while "
"blocking or attenuating lower and higher frequencies. It passes "
"frequencies between the two cut-off frequencies while attenuating "
"frequencies outside the cut-off frequencies. One typical application of a"
" band pass filter is in Audio Signal Processing, where a specific range "
"of frequencies of sound are desired while attenuating the rest. Another "
"application is in the selection of a specific signal from a range of "
"signals in communication systems. A band pass filter may be constructed "
"by cascading a High Pass RL filter with a roll-off frequency :math:`f_L` "
"and a Low Pass RC filter with a roll-off frequency :math:`f_H`, such "
"that:"
