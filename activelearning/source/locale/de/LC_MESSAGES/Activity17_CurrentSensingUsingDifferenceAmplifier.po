"We have investigated the difference_ amplifier_. Now we will use it as a "
"current sense amplifier. One of the major applications of the op-amp "
"difference amplifier is in measuring the current at point in a circuit "
"other than where it flows into or out of ground or the common node. The "
"current to be measured is converted into a small voltage by breaking open"
" the current path and inserting a low value resistor in series. This "
"resistor is called a current shunt resistor or just shunt. The resistance"
" is kept small and the voltage drop across the shunt small to reduce any "
"effect this change might have on the operation of the circuit. Current "
"going through shunt resistor therefore path current is given as"

"Since differential voltage across resistor (given as :math:`\\Delta V = "
"V_{R_{shunt_{node_1}}}-V_{R_{shunt_{node_2}}})` should be measured we can"
" see that a difference amplifier is an ideal circuit for that task. The "
"small differential voltage drop across the shunt is amplified and "
"converted to a single ended (common referenced) voltage by an op-amp "
"difference amplifier."
