"The Proportionality Theorem states that the response of a circuit is "

"The proportionality constant A is sometimes referred to as the gain of a "

"The Superposition Theorem states that the response of a linear circuit "
"with multiple independent sources, such as in figure 2, can be obtained "
"by adding the individual responses caused by the individual sources "
"acting alone. For an independent source acting alone, all other "
"independent voltage sources in the circuit are replaced by short circuits"
" and all other independent current sources are replaced by open circuits,"
" as in figure 3."
