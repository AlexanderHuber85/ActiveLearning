"The dc gain is measured by forcing the output of the DUT(OPAMP under test"
" a OP27 in our case) to move by a known amount (1V in our case, look at "
"Figure 2) by switching R5 between the DUT output (OP27 pin 6) and a 1V "
"reference (STEMlab OUT1 output) with switch S. If R5 is at +1V (Switch S "
"position POS2), then the DUT output (OP27 pin6) must move to –1V if the "
"input of the auxiliary amplifier is to remain unchanged near zero. The "
"voltage change at auxiliary amplifier output :math:`V_{out}` (OP97 pin "
"6), attenuated by **R3/R1** factor, is the input to the DUT(OP27 pin 3), "
"which causes a 1V change of output.It is simple to calculate the gain "
"from this:"

"In other words, DUT input differential voltage "
":math:`V_d=V^{+}+{V^-}`,(where :math:`V^-=0` and  :math:`V_d = V^+`), "
