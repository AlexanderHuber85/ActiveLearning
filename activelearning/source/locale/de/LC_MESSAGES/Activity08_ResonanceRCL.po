"A resonant circuit, also called a tuned circuit consists of an inductor "
"and a capacitor together with a voltage or current source. It is one of "
"the most important circuits used in electronics. For example, a resonant "
"circuit, in one of many forms, allows us to tune into a desired radio or "
"television station from the vast number of signals that are around us at "
"any time."

"The resonance frequency is defined as the frequency at which the "
"impedance_ of the circuit is at a minimum. Equivalently, it can be "
"defined as the frequency at which the impedance is purely real (that is, "
"purely resistive). This occurs because the impedances of the inductor and"
" capacitor at resonance are equal but of opposite sign and cancel out. "
"Circuits where L and C are in parallel rather than series actually have a"
" maximum impedance rather than a minimum impedance. For this reason they "
"are often described as antiresonators_, it is still usual, however, to "
"name the frequency at which this occurs as the resonance frequency."
