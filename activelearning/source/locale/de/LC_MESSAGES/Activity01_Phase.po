"The sin function results in a value from 1 to -1. First set t equal to a "

"With ω in radians, the sin of π/4 is approximately 0.7071. 2π radians "

"Now let t vary with time like it normally does. When the value of the ωt "

"Generally, capacitors are made of two conductive plates separated by a "

"plates, an electric field is created between the plates. Capacitor "
"dielectrics can be made of many materials, including thin insulating "

"The basic rule for capacitors is that the voltage across the capacitor "
"will not change unless there is a current flowing into the capacitor. The"

"One subtle thing about equation 4 is the imaginary operator j. When we "
"looked at a resistor for example there was no imaginary operator in the "
"equation for the impedance. The sinusoidal current through a resistor and"
" the voltage across a resistor have no time offset between them because "
"the relationship is completely real. The only difference is the "
"amplitude. The voltage is sinusoidal and is in phase with the current "
"sinusoid. This is not the case with a capacitor. When we look at the "
"waveform of a sinusoidal voltage across a capacitor it will be time "
"shifted compared to the current through the capacitor. The imaginary "
"operator, j, is responsible for this. Looking at figure 3 we can see that"
