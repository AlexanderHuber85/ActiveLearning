Voltage Division
################

Objective
_________

The objective of this Lab activity is to verify the voltage division properties of resistor networks.

Notes
_____

In this tutorials we use the terminology taken from the user manual when referring to the connections to the Red Pitaya STEMlab board hardware. Extension connector pins used as 5V voltage source are show in the documentation here.

Background
__________

Voltage division allow us to simplify the task of analyzing a circuit. Voltage Division allows us to calculate what fraction of the total voltage across a series string of resistors is dropped across any one resistor. For the circuit of Figure 1, the Voltage Division formulas are:

Materials
_________

Red Pitaya STEMlab 125-14 or STEMlab 125-10 
Various Resistors: 
 - 470 Ω, 
 - 1 KΩ, 
 - 4.7 KΩ,
 - 1.5 KΩ


Procedure
_________

a) Construct the circuit as shown in figure 1. Set R1= 4.7 KΩ, R2= 1.5 KΩ and use the fixed power supply 5V pin from extension connector as voltage source V\ :sub:`s`\. Use the Oscilloscope application to measure the voltages V\ :sub:`1`\ and V\ :sub:`2`\ Repeat this step for R\ :sub:`1`\ = R\ :sub:`2`\ = 4.7 KΩ and write down the measurements.

b) Calculate the voltages V\ :sub:`1`\ and V\ :sub:`2`\ by using the formulas (1) and (2) in each case.

c) Compare the results from steps a and 1.
