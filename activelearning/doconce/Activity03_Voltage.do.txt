Voltage Division
================

Objective
---------

The objective of this Lab activity is to verify the voltage division
properties of resistor networks.

Notes
-----

In this tutorials we use the terminology taken from the user manual when
referring to the connections to the Red Pitaya STEMlab board hardware.
Extension connector pins used as 5V voltage source are show in the
documentation here.

Background
----------

Voltage division allow us to simplify the task of analyzing a circuit.
Voltage Division allows us to calculate what fraction of the total
voltage across a series string of resistors is dropped across any one
resistor. For the circuit of Figure 1, the Voltage Division formulas
are:

$$V_1 = V_S \frac{R_1}{R_1 + R_2}$$$$V_2 = V_S \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}$$

Materials
---------

Red Pitaya STEMlab 125-14 or STEMlab 125-10 Various Resistors:

> -   470 Ω,
> -   1 KΩ,
> -   4.7 KΩ,
> -   1.5 KΩ

Procedure
---------

a)  Construct the circuit as shown in figure 1. Set R1= 4.7 KΩ, R2= 1.5
    KΩ and use the fixed power supply 5V pin from extension connector as
    voltage source V~s~. Use the Oscilloscope application to measure the
    voltages V~1~and V~2~Repeat this step for R~1~= R~2~= 4.7 KΩ and
    write down the measurements.
b)  Calculate the voltages V~1~and V~2~by using the formulas (1) and (2)
    in each case.
c)  Compare the results from steps a and 1.
