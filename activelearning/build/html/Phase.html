<h2>Background<a class="headerlink" href="#background" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We will investigate the concept of phase by looking at sine waves and passive components that will allow us to observe phase shift with real signals. First we will look at a sin wave and the phase term in the argument. You should be familiar with the equation:</p>
<div class="math">
\[f(t)= sin(ωt + θ)\]</div>
<p>ω sets the frequency of the sin wave as t progresses and θ defines an offset in time which defines a phase shift in the function.</p>
<p>The sin function results in a value from 1 to -1. First set t equal to a constant, say, 1. The argument, ωt, is now no longer a function of time. With ω in radians, the sin of π/4 is approximately 0.7071. 2π radians equals 360° so π/4 radians corresponds to 45°. In degrees the sin of 45° is also 0.7071.</p>
<p>Now let t vary with time like it normally does. When the value of the ωt changes linearly with time it yields a sin wave function as shown in figure 1. As ωt goes from 0 to 2π the sin wave goes from 0 up to 1 down to -1 and back to 0. This is one cycle or one period, T, of the sine wave. The x axis is the time varying argument/angle, ωt, which varies from 0 to 2π.</p>
<p>The value of θ is 0 in the function plotted in figure1. Since the sin(0) = 0 the plot starts at 0. This is a simple sine wave with no offset in time which means no phase offset. Note that if we are using degrees ωt, goes from 0 to 2π or 0 to 360° to yield the sine wave shown in figure 1.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id1">
<img alt="_images/Activity_1_Figure_1.png" src="_images/Activity_1_Figure_1.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">figure 1: 2 cycles of SIN(t)</span></p>
</div>
<p>As a side note, what happens when ωt is greater than 2π? Enter 2.5π in a calculator and see. As you should know the sine function repeats every 2π radians or 360°. It is similar to subtracting 2π(I) radians from the argument where I is the largest integer that yields a nonnegative result.</p>
<p>What happens when we plot a second sine wave function in figure 1 with ω the same value and θ is also 0? We have another sine wave which lands on top of the first sine wave. Since θ is 0 there is no phase difference between the sine waves and they look the same in time.</p>
<p>Now change θ to π/2 radians or 90° for the second waveform. We see the original sine wave and a sine wave shifted to the left in time. Figure 2 shows the original sin wave (green) and the second sin (orange) with an offset in time. Since the offset is a constant we see the original sin wave shifted in time by the value θ which in this example is 1/4 of the wave period.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id2">
<img alt="_images/Activity_1_Figure_2.png" src="_images/Activity_1_Figure_2.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">figure 2: green - SIN(t)  orange - SIN(t+ π/4)</span></p>
</div>
<p>Theta (<strong>θ</strong>) is the time offset or phase portion of equation 1. The phase angle defines the offset in time and vice versa. Equation 2 shows the relationship. We happened to choose a particularly common offset of 90°. The phase offset between a sine and cosine wave is 90°. The offset angle is almost always not 90. As a matter of fact is often a function of frequency.</p>
<p>When there are 2 sine waves for example displayed on a scope the phase angle can be calculated by measuring the time between the 2 waveforms (negative to positive zero crossings, or “rising edges”, can be used as time measurement reference points in the waveform). One full period of the sine wave in time is the same as 360°. Taking the ratio of the time between the 2 waveforms, ∆t, and the time in one period of a full sine wave, T, you can determine the angle between them. Equation 2 shows the exact relationship.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="phase">
<h2>Phase<a class="headerlink" href="#phase" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="math">
\[θ=\frac{∆t}{T} 360° = \frac{∆t}{T} 2π(rads) = ∆tf2π(rads)\]</div>
<p>Where T is the period of the sinusoid.</p>
<p><strong>Naturally occurring time offsets in sine waves.</strong></p>
<p>Some passive components yield a time offset between the voltage across them and the current through them. In class we showed that the voltage across and the current through a resistor was a simple time independent relationship. V/I=R. where R is real and in ohms. So the voltage across and current through a resistor are always in phase.</p>
<p>For capacitors and inductors the equation relating V to I is similar. V/I=Z, where Z is an impedance with real and imaginary components. We are only going to look at capacitors in this lab.</p>
<p>Generally, capacitors are made of two conductive plates separated by a dielectric material. When a potential difference is applied across the plates, an electric field is created between the plates. Capacitor dielectrics can be made of many materials, including thin insulating films and ceramic. A capacitor&#8217;s distinguishing characteristic is its capacitance (C), measured in Farads (F), which measures the ratio between voltage and charge buildup.</p>
<p>The basic rule for capacitors is that the voltage across the capacitor will not change unless there is a current flowing into the capacitor. The rate of change of the voltage (dv/dt) depends on the magnitude of the current. For an ideal capacitor the current i(t) is related to the voltage by the following formula:</p>
<div class="math">
\[i(t) = C \frac{dv}{dt}\]</div>
<p>Right now, the full implications of this is beyond the scope of this lab. You will observe this behavior in later labs. The impedance of a capacitor is a function of frequency. The impedance goes down with frequency conversely the lower the frequency the higher the impedance.</p>
<div class="math">
\[Z_c = \frac{1}{j ω C}\]</div>
<p>Where ω is defined as the angular velocity:</p>
<div class="math">
\[ω=2πf\]</div>
<p>One subtle thing about equation 4 is the imaginary operator j. When we looked at a resistor for example there was no imaginary operator in the equation for the impedance. The sinusoidal current through a resistor and the voltage across a resistor have no time offset between them because the relationship is completely real. The only difference is the amplitude. The voltage is sinusoidal and is in phase with the current sinusoid. This is not the case with a capacitor. When we look at the waveform of a sinusoidal voltage across a capacitor it will be time shifted compared to the current through the capacitor. The imaginary operator, j, is responsible for this. Looking at figure 3 we can see that the current waveform is at a peak ( maximum ) when the slope of the voltage waveform ( time rate of change dv/dt ) is its highest.</p>
<p>The time difference can be expressed as a phase angle between the two waveforms as defined in Equation 2.</p>

</div>
<p>You probably have seen circuits made entirely from resistors. These circuits have only real impedance, which means that voltages throughout the circuit will all be in phase (i.e. θ = 0 degrees) as it is the complex impedance that shifts the current in time with respect to the voltage.  Note that the impedance of a capacitor is wholly imaginary. Resistors have real impedances, so circuits that contain both resistors and capacitors will have complex impedances.</p>
<p>To calculate the theoretical phase angle between voltage and current in an RC circuit:</p>
<div class="math">
\[i(t) = \frac{v(t)}{Zc}\]</div>
<p>Where Zc is the total circuit impedance = I</p>
<p>Rearrange the equation until it looks like I=A+jB</p>
<p>Where A and B are real numbers.</p>
<p>The phase relationship of the current relative to the voltage is then:</p>
<div class="math">
\[θ = tan^{-1}(\frac{B}{A})\]</div>

<p>We have connected OUT1 directly to IN1 so we can observe a real voltage signal across resistors R<sub>1</sub>and R<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>In the OUT1 controls menu, set the Frequency  to 200 Hz with 0° Phase and 0.9 V amplitude. Deselect  “Show” button, select SINE waveform shape and select “ON” button.</li>
<li>Set the horizontal time scale to 1.0 mS/Div to display two cycles of the waveform.</li>
<li>Click on the scope Start button if it is not already running.</li>
<li>Using vertical +/- controls set  200 mV/div for IN1 and IN2</li>
</ul>
<p>The voltage waveform displayed in IN1(yellow) is the voltage across both resistors (V<sub>R1</sub>+V<sub>R2</sub>). The voltage waveform displayed in IN2 is the voltage across just R<sub>2</sub>(V<sub>R2</sub>). To display the voltage across R<sub>1</sub>we use the Math waveform display options. Under the Math menu for Signal1 select IN1, select operator “-”, for Signal2 select IN2 then select enable. You should now see a third waveform for the voltage across R<sub>1</sub>(V<sub>R1</sub>).
• Using vertical +/- controls set  200 mV/div (0.2 V/div) for MATH trace.</p>
<p>With this settings you are observing:
IN1- Input excitation signal
IN2- Voltage drop signal across R<sub>2</sub>MATH - Voltage drop signal across R<sub>1</sub></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Record V<sub>R1</sub>and V<sub>R2</sub>.</li>
</ul>
<p>V<sub>R1</sub>_______V<sub>pp</sub>.</p>
<p>V<sub>R2</sub>_______V<sub>pp</sub>.</p>
<p>V<sub>R1</sub>+V<sub>R2</sub>_______V<sub>pp</sub>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Can you see any difference between the zero crossings of V<sub>R1</sub>and V<sub>R2</sub>? _________</li>
<li>Can you even see two distinct sine waves? ________</li>
</ul>
<p>Probably not. There should be no observable time offset and thus no phase shift.</p>
<p>You can see that MATH (purple) and IN2 (green) trace are overlapping. To see both traces you can adjust the vertical position of a channel to separate them.
This can be done by selecting trace marker(on the left side of the grid) using mouse left button and moving trace up-down. Make sure to set the vertical position back to 0 to realign the signals.
Here we don’t have phase shift and value of R<sub>1</sub>= R<sub>2</sub>so the signal amplitudes for V<sub>R1</sub>and V<sub>R2</sub>will be the same. The result is that we have two identical signals (IN2=V<sub>R2</sub>, MATH=V<sub>R1</sub>) on the Oscilloscope.
What happens if you use 220 Ohm value for R<sub>2</sub>?</p>
<p>4. Measuring RC circuit
• Replace R<sub>2</sub>with a 1 uF capacitor C<sub>1</sub>.</p>

<p>NOTICE: For 1uF capacitor you will be probably using an electrolytic capacitor.
This capacitors are polarity sensitive i.e  on the positive capacitor pin the voltage should never go negative and on negative pin (GND) voltage should never go positive.</p>
<p>From previous example (RR circuit ) and Oscilloscope &amp; Signal generator settings we are generating sine wave which is going from -0.9V to 0.9V and causing a wrong polarization of capacitor(it can damage a capacitor) we need to adjust our output signal so we generate a sine signal which is always positive (sine signal with an offset).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>In the OUT1 settings menu set Amplitude and Offset values  to 0.45 V
(Now we are generating sine signal which is oscillating around 0.45 V of DC offset value i.e sine signal is going  from 0 to 0.9V )</li>
</ul>
<p>Because there is no DC current through the capacitor we are not interested in this DC value. In order to re-center our signals on the grid we need to shift signals in vertical direction using negative offset values.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>In the IN1 and IN2 settings menu set the value of Vertical Offset to -450mV</li>
<li>For the stable acquisition set the trigger level in TRIGGER menu to 0.45V</li>

<p>Now something to do with phase. Hopefully you see a few sine waves with time offsets or phase differences displayed on the grid. Let&#8217;s measure the time offsets and calculate the phase differences.
5. Measure the time difference between V<sub>R1</sub>and V<sub>C1</sub>. and calculate the phase offsets.
Use equation 2 and the measured ∆t to calculate the phase angle θ.</p>
<p>The CURSORS are useful for determining ∆t. Here&#8217;s how.
• Display at least 2 cycles of the sine waves.
• Set the horizontal time/div  to  500us/div.
Note the Delta  cursor display keeps track of the sign of the difference.
You can use the measurement display to get frequency. Since you set the frequency of the source you don&#8217;t really need to depend on the measurement window for this value.
Assume ∆t is 0 if you really can&#8217;t see any difference with 1 or 2 cycles of the sine wave on the screen.
• Put a first cursor at the neg. to pos. zero crossing location for the IN1 ( V<sub>R1</sub>+ V<sub>C1</sub>) signal. Put a second cursor at the nearest neg. to pos. zero crossing location for the Math ( V<sub>R1</sub>) signal. Record the time difference and calculate the phase angle. Note ∆t maybe a negative number. Does this mean the phase angle leads or lags?</p>

<li>Put a first cursor at the neg. to pos. zero crossing location for the Math ( V<sub>R1</sub>) signal. Put a second cursor at the nearest neg. to pos. zero crossing location for the IN2 ( V<sub>C1</sub>) signal. Record the time difference and calculate the phase angle.</li>
</ul>

<p>6. Measure the time difference and calculate the phase θ offset at a different frequency.
• Set OUT1 frequency to 1000 Hz and the time / div to 200us/div.
• Put a first cursor at the neg. to pos. zero crossing location for the IN1 ( V<sub>R1</sub>+ V<sub>C1</sub>) signal. Put a second cursor at the nearest neg. to pos. zero crossing location for the Math ( V<sub>R1</sub>) signal. Record the time difference and calculate the phase angle. Note ∆t maybe a negative number. Does this mean the phase angle leads or lags?</p>
